  <p class="text-muted">A school library (or a school library media center) is a library within
     a school where students, staff, and often, parents of a public or private school have access
      to a variety of resourcesSchool libraries provide more than just books, computers and other
       technology, databases of accurate information, e-books, plus fun and educational activities.
   School libraries provide a safe haven for all students to think, create, share, and grow..As
    gateways to knowledge and culture, libraries play a fundamental role in society. The resources
     and services they offer create opportunities for learning, support literacy and education,
      and help shape the new ideas and perspectives that are central to a creative and innovative
       society.</p>

       With a little innovative thought and creative design, the modern high school auditorium can
        serve as the foundation for learning about the arts in your community, while performing as
         a flexible and essential component of the school.As a secondary function, the auditorium
          may serve as a place for general entertain- ments, community meetings, and lectures. possible
     to see any part of the stage from any seat in the house. "" An auditorium of this size will 
     accommodate groups of pupils of two or three grades at a time, as seems desirable.

<p>Environmental pollution is the major source of problems in human health and the sustainable
   development of society and economy in the world. The presence of environmental pollutants
    (i.e., heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants etc.)Major forms of pollution include
     air pollution, light pollution, litter, noise pollution, plastic pollution, soil contamination, 
     radioactive contamination, thermal pollution, visual pollution, and water pollution.An increased 
     risk of heart disease, wheezing, coughing, and respiratory problems and skin, nose, and throat
      irritation can be caused by high levels of air pollution. Air Pollution affects human health 
      in different ways, Air pollution may also cause heart attacks, asthma, and other respiratory
       complications.

<p>Football, also called association football or soccer, is a game involving two teams of 11 players who
   try to maneuver the ball into the other team's goal without using their hands or arms. The team that
    scores more goals wins. Football is the world's most popular ball game in numbers of participants
     and spectators.Charles Alcock, who was elected to secretary of the FA at the age of 28, devised
      the idea of an international competition, inaugurating an annual Scotland-England fixture. In 
      1870 and 1871 he placed advertisements in Edinburgh and Glasgow newspapers, requesting players
       for an international between the two countries.</p>

<p>I prepared "Heroin's Fountain" for Inter School Science Project Competition.Heron's fountain 
  is a hydraulic machine that demonstrates the principles of hydraulics and pneumatics. Flow of
   water from high gravitational potential energy to low gravitational potential energy causes
    a fountain to form, due to increasing pressure on the inside of the system.As the warm air
     inside cools down, the falling pressure is immediately equalised by the water rising into
      the straw. The higher pressure outside the bottle forces the water up, which reduces the 
      volume of air inside, which equalises the pressure. But the fountain really gets going
       when the cold water touches the glass.</p>

<h4>New School Canteen</h4>

<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with the photographs of the items prepared, and detailed description of their ingriedents help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a school canteen account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

<h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>
<img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1.  Accuracy
  Humans are prone to error,even if we provide them with supportung computational devices.Automated attendance
  management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors eith manual data 
  entry.this accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
  <br>
  2.Economics
  Have you ever thought that attendence management systems could control costs? it savesmoney by putting an end
  to inaaccurate timereporting ,buddy punching,absenteeism,tardness,time abuse,and overpayment.As a matter
  of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organization save up to $1,600 per employee after
  implementing automated attendance management systems.
  <br>
  3. Productivity / Efficiency
  Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming,labrious,and expensive affair.It takes
  time to process paper sheets and time cards,create schedules,authorize leave and overtime, and create
  payroll manually.Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you,from 
  keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system.The time and 
  effort saved combined with  data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased
  productivity and improves profits.And many more like visiblity/Insights,Hassel Free Workflow Management,
  Flexibility,Integration / Configuration,Real-time tracking,Security, and Compliance.
